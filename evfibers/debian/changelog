libevfibers (0.3.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fiber names are now gettable/settable
  * Also a name is now an array, embedded into a fiber structure to simplify
    memory management.
  * Support for fiber-local storage
  * fbr_reclaim fixes. Now when a fiber is reclaimed, it's filtered out from
    the stack to make sure that fbr_yield will not ield to a reclaimed fiber.
    Also fbr_reclaim of self will now never return.
  * Switched fbr_need_log and fbr_set_log_level to static inline
  * Now passing real fiber stack size to coro_create
  * Added ``active'' flag to destructor. To support this I've also added static
    and dynamic initializers for a destructor structure.
  * Moved fbr_mutex, fbr_cond_var, fbr_buffer into public API to allow stack
    allocation of these structures which should result in some speedup.
  * Protected libev watchers with desctructors. Now when doing fbr_read a
    destructor is set before fbr_ev_wait that will stop the watcher in case
    fiber is reclaimed while we were waiting.
  * ev_now() timestamp in default logger
  * Fixed fbr_ev_wait_one behaviour to match documentation
  * Added missing call of destructors upon fiber reclaim
  * Added stack-allocatable destructor API
  * More rethinking and reworking of the event facility (see 701e067)
